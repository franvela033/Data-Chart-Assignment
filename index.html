            <p> On Apr. 3, 2020, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued an enforcement notice — obligating that the U.S. and foreign-based airlines issue full refunds for all canceled flights to customers due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
            <p> Just days before this announcement, the Department of Transportation received over 200 applications from airlines, according to a report by The Washington Post. The airline industry looked to solve the impact of restricted airline travel and has since, asked for loans and payroll grants.
            <p>With customers unable to travel due to shelter-in-place orders, airlines began issuing travel vouchers and or travel credit hoping to save themselves some extra money and offset the dwindling numbers in revenue.  Some customers however, purchased non-refundable tickets and began complaining. As complaints began to accumulate, customers grew impatient.</p>
            <p>American Airlines and United saw the largest rise in customer refund complaints during July of this year, according to data provided in the chart below, which is acquired monthly by the Office of Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings. The complaints look specifcally at a five-year-period during the month of July since 2015.</p>

  <p>Dennis Tajer, An American Airlines pilot and a member of the Allied Pilots Association, the largest independent pilots’ union that represents an estimated 15,000 pilots, is hopeful about the increased funding that will aid the airline industry and its direct employees.</p>
  <p> “We value our customers and understand money is tight. Issuing travel vouchers was our way of providing the next best option. We were managing as best we could at the time, considering the circumstances," he said. </p>
